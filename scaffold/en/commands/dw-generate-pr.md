<system_instructions>
You are an assistant specialized in creating well-documented Pull Requests. Your task is to generate a PR on GitHub with a structured summary of all implemented changes.

## When to Use
- Use when creating a Pull Request from a feature or bugfix branch to main/develop
- Do NOT use when changes are not yet committed (use `/dw-commit` first)
- Do NOT use when code review has not been done (use `/dw-code-review` first)

## Pipeline Position
**Predecessor:** `/dw-code-review` or `/dw-commit` | **Successor:** (merge)

## Complementary Skills

| Skill | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `dw-verify` | **ALWAYS** — invoked before `git push`. Without a VERIFICATION REPORT PASS in the current session AFTER the last code edit, the PR **CANNOT** be created. |
| `dw-git-discipline` | **ALWAYS** — validates branch naming (`<type>/<scope>` kebab-case), atomic-commit history (each commit single-intent, conventional message), branch lifetime (flag if >7 days old), and PR scope (suggest split if diff > ~400 lines). PR description follows summary + test plan structure, not a `git log` dump. |
| `/dw-security-check` | **ALWAYS for TS/Python/C#/Rust projects** — `security-check.md` with status ≠ REJECTED is required for supported-language projects. |

<critical>Hard gate 1 (verify): if the current session has no VERIFICATION REPORT PASS from `dw-verify` produced AFTER the last edit/commit, STOP and invoke `dw-verify` before proceeding. A PR is a permanent artifact — it demands the highest verification standard.</critical>

<critical>Hard gate 2 (security): for TS/Python/C#/Rust projects, if `{{PRD_PATH}}/security-check.md` is missing OR has REJECTED status, STOP and invoke `/dw-security-check` before proceeding. HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities CANNOT reach the PR. For other languages (Go, Java, etc.), this gate is skipped with a note.</critical>

## Usage

```
/dw-generate-pr [target-branch]
```

Examples:
- `/dw-generate-pr main`
- `/dw-generate-pr develop`

## Objective

Create a Pull Request on GitHub with a structured summary, push the branch, copy the body to clipboard, and open the PR creation page in the browser.

## Process

### 1. Pre-PR Checks

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
# Should be on feat/prd-[name] or similar

# Check if there are commits for the PR
git log [target-branch]..HEAD --oneline

# Check if everything is committed
git status

# Get org/repo from remote
git remote get-url origin
```

### 2. Push to Remote

```bash
# If branch does not exist on remote
git push -u origin [branch-name]

# If it already exists
git push origin [branch-name]
```

### Branch Type Detection
- If `feat/prd-*`: Read `.dw/spec/prd-*/prd.md` for feature summary
- If `fix/*`: Use commit messages as summary, reference bug report
- Otherwise: Use commit messages

### 3. Collect Information

- Read the PRD for a feature summary
- List all branch commits
- Identify files modified by project/module

```bash
# Branch commits
git log [target-branch]..HEAD --pretty=format:"- %s"

# Modified files
git diff --name-only [target-branch]..HEAD

# Group by project/module
git diff --name-only [target-branch]..HEAD | head -20

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

### 4. Generate PR Body

Build the body following the template below, filling in with collected information.

### 5. Copy to Clipboard and Open URL

1. **Copy the body to the clipboard**
   ```bash
   echo "[PR BODY]" | xclip -selection clipboard
   # or
   echo "[PR BODY]" | xsel --clipboard
   ```

2. **Open PR creation URL in browser**
   ```bash
   xdg-open "https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/compare/[target-branch]...[branch-name]?expand=1"
   ```

3. **Instruct the user** to paste the body (Ctrl+V) in the description field

## PR Template (copy to clipboard)

```markdown
## Summary

- [Bullet 1: main feature]
- [Bullet 2: secondary feature]
- [Bullet 3: if applicable]

## Changes

### [Module/Project 1] (if applicable)
- `path/to/[module]/` - [description]
- `path/to/[route]/` - [description]

### [Module/Project 2] (if applicable)
- `path/to/[module]/` - [description]

### Database
- [Schema changes, if any]

## Test Plan

- [ ] Unit tests passing (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Build without errors
- [ ] Lint without warnings
- [ ] Manually tested:
  - [ ] [Specific test 1]
  - [ ] [Specific test 2]

## Deploy Notes

- [ ] Migrations needed? [Yes/No]
- [ ] New environment variables? [Yes/No]
- [ ] Deploy order: [project1 -> project2]

## Related

- PRD: `.dw/spec/prd-[name]/prd.md`
- TechSpec: `.dw/spec/prd-[name]/techspec.md`

For bugfix PRs, use the bugfix PR template in `.dw/templates/pr-bugfix-template.md`.

## Rules

1. **Always check status** before creating PR
2. **Push required** before opening URL
3. **Concise title** - maximum 70 characters
4. **Summary with bullets** - focus on what was implemented
5. **Group by project/module** - if multi-project, separate sections
6. **Complete Test Plan** - checkboxes for QA
7. **Copy body before opening** - makes filling easier

## Expected Output

```
## Pull Request

### Branch
[branch-name] -> [target-branch]

### Push
Push completed: git push origin [branch-name]

### Impacted Projects
- [project-1]: [X] files
- [project-2]: [Y] files

### Included Commits
1. feat([module]): [description]
2. feat([module]): [description]

### Clipboard
PR body copied to clipboard

### URL
Opening: https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/compare/[target-branch]...[branch-name]?expand=1

### Next Steps
1. URL opened in browser
2. Paste the body (Ctrl+V) in the description field
3. Adjust the title if needed
4. Click "Create Pull Request"
5. Await code review
```

## Troubleshooting

### xclip/xsel not installed
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install xclip
# or
sudo apt install xsel
```

### Branch does not exist on remote
```bash
git push -u origin [branch-name]
```

### Conflicts with target branch
```bash
git fetch origin [target-branch]
git rebase origin/[target-branch]
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin [branch-name] --force-with-lease
```

### Browser does not open (WSL)
```bash
# Configure default browser in WSL
export BROWSER="/mnt/c/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"
# Or copy the URL and open manually
```

<critical>Always copy the body to the clipboard BEFORE opening the URL</critical>
